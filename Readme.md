# Venturit Frontend technical test

This is the repository for the frontend technical test of the full stack developer job offer.

In this repository, you can find two folders: [Backend](https://github.com/eltranseunteurbano/technical-test/tree/main/back "Backend") and [frontend](https://github.com/eltranseunteurbano/technical-test/tree/main/front "frontend")

## Frontend
For this challenge, I decided to make a Frontend app made with:
- React Js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- React Hook Form
- React Query
- Vitest
- Vite
- eslint
- prettier
- date-fns

##### Commands
To run the project, run the following commands.

```
cd /front
npm install
npm run dev
```

------------
## Backend
For the backend, I decided to build a go app; and avoid to use json-server with the [db file](https://github.com/eltranseunteurbano/technical-test/tree/main/db "db file"). 
But also, you can avoid running the go app, and run the json server service.

```
json-server db/db.json
```
